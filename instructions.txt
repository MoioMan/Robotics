** File description **
src/baseline_calibrator.cpp:    Node which is has been run separately only to estimate the apparent baseline and the gear ratio
src/motor_synchronizer.cpp:     Node which synchronize the motor speed messages. Then, estimate linear and angular velocity and publishes a Twist.
src/reset_odom_to_zero.cpp:     Node client which send a request in order to reset the odometry to (0,0,0). It sends the request and then terminate
src/reset_odom_to_pose.cpp:     Node client which send a request in order to reset the odometry to (x,y,theta). It keep spinning and sends request when asked by the user 
src/odometry_pub.cpp:           Node which integrate the Twist message from motor_synchronizer using the selected integration method, 
                                then publish the computed odometry. Moreover, It listen to request for resetting the estimated odometry.

msg/SkidOdometry.msg            Custom message published by odometry_pub. Contains the odometry object and the selected integration method.
        -- Structure            nav_msgs/Odometry    odom
                                std_msgs/String      method

srv/resetToPose.srv             Service definition to reset the odometry to (x, y, theta). Request = 3 params (x, y, theta), Reply = 1 param (result)
srv/resetToZero.srv             Service definition to reset the odometry to (x, y, theta). Request = 3 params (x, y, theta), Reply = 1 param (result)

launch/project.launch           Launch file for ros.

CMakeList.txt / package.xml     Usual files to instruct catkin

** ROS Parameters ** 
"use_sim_time"                  Used only to run rvix under simulation timing
"wheelRadius"                   Constant value for the wheel radius
"realBaseline"                  Constant value for the real baseline
"apparentBaseline"              Constant value for the apparent baseline which has been previously estimate by baseline_calibrator node
"gearRatio"                     Constant value for the apparent baseline which has been previously estimate by baseline_calibrator node
"useCustomMessage"              True/false used by odometry_pub to decide whether to publish the custom message or the usual Odometry msg
"x", "y", "theta"               Initial pose values. They are needed by the odometry_pub as starting point for the integration
